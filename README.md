In vivo physiology of rat visual cortical neurons.

This repository houses the code and analytical tools developed to investigate motion processing in the rat visual cortex, specifically focusing on drifting grating and plaid responses as well as correlated noise responses of neurons in areas V1 and LM RL. The code is designed to preprocess neural data and to run several analyses on the neuronal responses.

To use the code it is necessary to get the raw data from other source. Raw data (including simuli, bitcode traces and ephys spike sorted data) should be stored in folders called "stims" "bitcodes" and "raw_data".
